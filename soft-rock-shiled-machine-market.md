<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soft-Rock Shiled Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Slurry Shield (SS)</li><li>Earth Pressure Balance Machines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Soft-Rock Shield Machine market primarily consists of two key types: Slurry Shield (SS) and Earth Pressure Balance (EPB) machines. Slurry Shield machines utilize a bentonite slurry to balance soil pressure and facilitate excavation in soft geological conditions, ideal for managing water inflow. In contrast, Earth Pressure Balance machines maintain soil stability by using the excavated material to support tunnel walls, allowing for efficient tunneling in softer ground. Both technologies cater to specific project requirements in underground construction.</p></p>
