<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dermal Allograft Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cellular Allograft</li><li>Acellular Allograft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dermal allograft market is divided into two main types: cellular allografts and acellular allografts. Cellular allografts contain living cells, promoting enhanced healing and tissue regeneration, making them suitable for complex wounds and reconstructive surgeries. In contrast, acellular allografts are processed to remove cells while retaining the extracellular matrix, providing structural support with a lower risk of immune rejection. Both types serve vital roles in wound healing, reconstructive procedures, and trauma management, catering to diverse patient needs.</p></p>
